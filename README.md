# Bike Rent Price Prediction with Random Forest Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts housing prices using the Random Forest regression algorithm. This project is designed to help you understand and implement predictive modeling for real estate pricing.
# Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the rent prices of bikes based on various features and attributes. It utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble method, to build a robust regression model. In bike sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. Hence, a bike rental company wants to understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on the environment and seasons.
# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:  
   * Bike_Data.csv : Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
   * Bike_Rent.ipynb : Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
   * README.md : The document you are currently reading.
# Objectives  
  * Performe exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to understand the environmental and seasonal settings
  * Predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm
